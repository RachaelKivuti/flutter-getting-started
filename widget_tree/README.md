# Widget Tree

➤ The fundamentals of widgets

➤ To use a full widget tree

➤ To use a shallow widget tree


#### The Three ways to create a shallow widget tree by refactoring:
       -with a constant 
 
       -with a method 
 
       -with a widget class.

#### Widgets used

➤ Scaffold—Implements the Material Design visual layout, allowing the use of Flutter’s
Material Components widgets

➤ AppBar—Implements the toolbar at the top of the screen

➤ CircleAvatar—Usually used to show a rounded user profile photo, but you can use it
for any image

➤ Divider—Draws a horizontal line with padding above and below

#### Widgets can be used with both Material Design and Cupertino(for iOS):


➤ SingleChildScrollview—This adds vertical or horizontal scrolling ability to a single
child widget.

➤ Padding—This adds left, top, right, and bottom padding.

➤ Column—This displays a vertical list of child widgets.

➤ Row—This displays a horizontal list of child widgets.

➤ Container—This widget can be used as an empty placeholder (invisible) or can specify
height, width, color, transform (rotate, move, skew), and many more properties.

➤ Expanded—This expands and fills the available space for the child widget that belongs to a
Column or Row widget.

➤ Text—The Text widget is a great way to display labels on the screen. It can be configured
to be a single line or multiple lines. An optional style argument can be applied to change
the color, font, size, and many other properties.

➤ Stack—Stack lets you stack widgets on top of each other and use
a Positioned (optional) widget to align each child of the Stack for the layout needed. 

➤ Positioned—The Positioned widget works with the Stack widget to control child positioning and size. A Positioned widget allows you to set the height and width. You can
also specify the position location distance from the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the
Stack widget.
